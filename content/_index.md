# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Seth Delorme. I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan with my wife, two pretty great tiny kids, and two doods.

Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Gambyt](https://www.gambyt.com/) working on some online real money gaming stuff (mostly iLottery).

Before the software stuff I was a teacher and assistant principal on Chicago's West Side -- which was pretty great.
