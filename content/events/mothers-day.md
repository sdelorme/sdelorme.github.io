Join us in celebrating all the amazing women in our lives this Mother's Day! I'd hand the hosting duties over to Quinn, but he's currently deep in his career as a full-time Transformer, so I'm taking the reins. We hope to see everyone there! Let Seth know if you plan on coming by -- and reach out with any questions.

### Event Details

### About the Event

We're going with a **Mamas de Mayo** theme here. The dude's are hosting this one, so ladies sit back and relax. Seth and Tommy D will be setting up the main course:

- Shrimp, Steak, and Chicken Taco bar (plenty of veggies for the meatless folk)
- Queso Dip
- A big ol' bottle of tequila.
- Some corny dad jokes

  {{< highlight >}}The rest of you good looking gentlemen, consult with the ladies and bring something delicious to go with the tacos.{{< /highlight >}}

Cheers!
